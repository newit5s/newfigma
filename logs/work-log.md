## Test Phrase 5
- Added the fifth verification entry to continue the chronological audit of modernization deliverables.
- Reviewed the shipping booking management assets before updating acceptance and testing checklists for Phase 5.
- Noted the outstanding drag-and-drop calendar work so future iterations can target that gap explicitly.

## Phase 5 Checklist Verification
- Inspected `public/partials/booking-management.php` to confirm the table view, calendar toggle, filters, and bulk-action toolbar mirror the prompt layout while pulling real data attributes for locations and statuses.
- Audited `assets/js/booking-management.js` to verify the BookingManagement controller wires filters, pagination, bulk operations, and AJAX endpoints together, with specialized helpers for the table, filters, bulk actions, and calendar view.
- Confirmed `public/partials/booking-calendar-view.php` provides the reusable calendar scaffold and legends that the calendar manager populates.
- Checked `public/class-modern-booking-manager.php` for WordPress integration, ensuring assets are enqueued, nonce-localized, and AJAX handlers exist for list, calendar, update, bulk, reminder, and export operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Management Layout & Views**
   - [x] `booking-management.php` renders the header, view toggle, filters, bulk toolbar, and sortable table shell required for table and calendar workflows.
2. **Advanced Filtering & Search**
   - [x] `BookingFilterManager` syncs date range, status, location, search debounce, clear/reset controls, and triggers table/calendar reloads.
3. **Calendar Rendering**

5. **WordPress Integration & Security**
   - [x] Modern booking manager enqueues design system assets, localizes nonces/defaults, and guards AJAX endpoints with capability checks.
6. **Drag & Drop Rescheduling**
   - [ ] Drag-and-drop interactions are not yet implemented; the calendar currently binds click events only, so rescheduling still needs to be built.

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Toggling between table and calendar views updates visibility and loads the corresponding data.
- [x] Adjusting date range, status, location, and search filters refreshes results and pagination.
- [x] Bulk confirm, pending, cancel, and reminder actions operate on the selected booking IDs and clear the selection afterward.
- [x] Export action submits the current filters and downloads a CSV payload when the response is non-JSON.
- [x] Calendar navigation buttons, view modes, and today shortcut refresh the schedule grid with server data.
- [ ] Drag-and-drop rescheduling is pending implementation; no draggable handlers exist yet in the calendar view.

## Test Phrase 6
- Logged the sixth verification request to capture the Phase 1–6 compliance audit discussed with the stakeholder.
- Summarized the three outstanding gaps (bootstrap file absence, animation tokens, and theme manager integration) identified during the review.
- Clarified that these gaps stem from early-phase requirements rather than the Phase 7–8 scopes, aligning expectations for follow-up work.
- Documented specific issues discovered so they can be tracked explicitly in future remediation work:
  - Plugin bootstrap file (`restaurant-booking-manager.php` plus supporting `admin/` and `includes/` loaders) is missing, so WordPress cannot initialize the shipped classes.
  - Design system lacks the animation token set and shared `@keyframes` definitions requested in Phase 1, leaving motion guidance incomplete.
  - `theme-manager.js` is not enqueued across primary portal/booking views, preventing the global theme toggle from functioning consistently outside the style guide.

## Remediation Status Review
- Conducted a follow-up audit to capture which previously flagged issues have now been addressed and to document the defects that still block end-to-end functionality.

### Issues Resolved
- Plugin bootstrap and loader stack now exist, allowing WordPress to bootstrap the feature classes through `restaurant-booking-manager.php` and the `includes/class-plugin-manager.php` loader chain.
- Animation token library has been added in `assets/css/animations.css`, providing shared motion variables and keyframes for the modern UI.
- `assets/js/theme-manager.js` is enqueued across admin and portal entry points (including the booking widget, authentication screen, dashboard, and management modules), restoring synchronized light/dark theme behavior outside the style guide demo.
- Implemented `includes/services/class-rb-analytics.php` and registered it with the plugin loader so the portal dashboard can instantiate `RB_Analytics` without triggering fatal errors.

### Outstanding Problems
- No outstanding remediation items identified after the latest data model and admin interface updates.

## Remediation Follow-up – Data Models & Admin UI
- Replaced the placeholder booking, location, and table models with database-aware implementations so analytics queries, admin dashboards, and the booking manager screens operate on live data instead of hardcoded values.
- Implemented `RB_Analytics_Service` to aggregate booking statistics, time-series trends, and popular time slots, enabling the dashboard to surface meaningful KPIs.
- Added the missing `assets/css/modern-admin.css` and `assets/js/modern-admin.js` bundles that power the WordPress admin experience, eliminating 404 errors and rendering the modern dashboard layout with interactive data fetching.
- Verified that the new data access layer degrades gracefully when custom tables are absent, returning empty datasets without fatal errors.

## Test Phrase 7
- Captured the seventh verification phrase to mark the completion of the WordPress admin modernization scope.
- Summarized the PHP helper work that unlocks the new dashboard cards, badge counts, and booking summaries introduced in Phase 7.
- Noted that the bookings endpoint now returns the enriched summary payload consumed by `assets/js/modern-admin.js`, enabling the UI to render KPIs and status chips without placeholders.

## Phase 7 Checklist Verification
- Reviewed `admin/class-modern-admin.php` to confirm the new dashboard summary, badge count, and currency helpers return the data structures used by the rebuilt admin UI templates.
- Audited `includes/models/class-booking.php` to verify the admin query now accepts extended filters, calculates status totals, revenue, and average party size, and exposes a safe fallback summary when the bookings table is absent.
- Confirmed that shared helpers such as `RB_Booking::count_by_status` and the new summary builder degrade gracefully when custom tables or columns are missing, preventing fatal errors in legacy installations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Dashboard Summary Aggregation**
   - [x] `build_dashboard_summary()` totals bookings, revenue, occupancy, and top-location insights for the dashboard header cards.
   - [x] Location stats guard against missing table data while still surfacing pending counts for badge indicators.
2. **Badge Counts & Currency Formatting**
   - [x] `get_pending_badge_count()` delegates to `RB_Booking::count_by_status()` with a safe fallback when the helper is unavailable.
   - [x] `format_currency()` respects WordPress currency filters and locale-aware number formatting.
3. **Booking Endpoint Summary**
   - [x] `get_admin_bookings()` now accepts pagination, sorting, and filtering arguments while always returning a summary block for the UI cards.
   - [x] `query_bookings()` supports `include_summary` to calculate revenue totals, status counts, guest averages, and pending badges alongside the paginated rows.
4. **Model Utilities & Fallbacks**
   - [x] Introduced `RB_Booking::count_by_status()` so dashboard and navigation badges display live counts.
   - [x] Added `get_empty_summary()` to guarantee consistent payloads even when custom database tables are unavailable.

### Testing Checklist
- [x] `php -l admin/class-modern-admin.php`
- [x] `php -l includes/models/class-booking.php`
- [x] Reviewed `assets/js/modern-admin.js` expectations to confirm summary keys (`total_revenue`, `status_counts`, `average_party_size`) match the updated PHP responses.
- [x] Manually inspected guard clauses for `RB_Table` and bookings table availability to ensure empty datasets do not trigger errors.

## Test Phrase 8
- Logged the eighth verification phrase to confirm the mobile optimisation and PWA enhancements requested for Phase 8.
- Summarised the new mobile navigation shell, pull-to-refresh gestures, offline banner, and install prompt shipped with this iteration.
- Recorded that **PHRASE 8** ("Mobile optimization và PWA enhancement hoàn thành...") now applies to the manager portal experience.

## Phase 8 Checklist Verification
- Audited `public/partials/portal-dashboard.php`, `assets/css/portal-dashboard-mobile.css`, and `assets/js/mobile-dashboard.js` to confirm the responsive layout, touch interactions, and offline affordances match the prompt guidance.
- Verified that `public/class-modern-dashboard.php` enqueues the new mobile bundles and localises service worker + manifest URLs so the dashboard registers the PWA assets when rendered.
- Confirmed that the new `manifest.json` and root-level `sw.js` files provide a lightweight offline fallback and installable metadata aligned with the mobile enhancements brief.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Mobile Navigation & Layout**
   - [x] Mobile header, navigation drawer, and bottom navigation rendered in `portal-dashboard.php` with dedicated styles in `portal-dashboard-mobile.css`.
2. **Touch Interactions & Gestures**
   - [x] `mobile-dashboard.js` wires swipe actions for booking cards, quick action buttons, and haptic feedback helpers.
3. **Pull-to-Refresh & Offline Messaging**
   - [x] Pull-to-refresh indicator, success toast, and offline banner implemented for the mobile content container.
4. **Progressive Web App Support**
   - [x] Service worker registered via the mobile script with offline fallback while `manifest.json` exposes install metadata.
5. **Responsive Dashboard Metrics**
   - [x] Mobile stat cards reuse initial dashboard data and surface trend percentages with appropriate formatting.

### Testing Checklist
- [x] `php -l public/class-modern-dashboard.php`
- [x] `php -l public/partials/portal-dashboard.php`
- [x] Manually reviewed `assets/js/mobile-dashboard.js` and `sw.js` to confirm registration paths and caching strategy align with the plugin directory scope.
